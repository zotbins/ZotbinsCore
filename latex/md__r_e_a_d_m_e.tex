The current version of newzotbinscore can\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Detect trash items
\item Measure trash weight and bin fullness
\item Efficiently manage processing resources by suspending sensor tasks until a piece of trash is detected by the breakbeam
\item Connect to the Zotbins AWS IoT MQTT broker
\item Serialize and publish data to the MQTT broker as a JSON string
\item .clang-\/format provides settings for maintaining code consistency without making any breaking changes
\end{DoxyItemize}

Action items\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Classes to protect variables
\item MCP23017 GPIO extender firmware
\item OV2460 external camera module without the ESP-\/\+CAM board
\item Replace ultrasonic sensor with time of flight sensor
\item OTA updates
\item Servo motor and timing
\item automatic build (Git\+Hub Actions)
\item Get ESP32 debug board working again
\item Change pin layout (ex. Weight sensor uses GPIO 2, however this is a strapping pin which changes the boot mode of the device)
\item Bluetooth to interface with bin users
\item LCD screen, speaker, and buttons to provide real-\/time waste info on the bin
\item Implement peripheral\+\_\+queue, which will manage a queue of messages to publish in case the ESP drops the connection
